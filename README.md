# A Hypothetical Martian Calendar Using International Fixed Calendar Proposal

Jairo Moreno de Barros Junior

## Abstract

This paper proposes 'Mars' Master Calendar,' a hypothetical calendar designed for Mars, utilizing the International Fixed Calendar (IFC) concept, adapted for the unique orbital and rotational characteristics of Mars. The Martian sol (day) is divided into 27 hours, each consisting of 55 Martian minutes, to maintain consistency and avoid fractional time periods. The proposed calendar structure includes 13 months with equal sol distribution and an intercalary day to account for the exact length of the Martian year. This calendar signifies the start of a new interplanetary civilization and culture, beginning with the first human settlement landing on Mars.

## Introduction

Mars, with its rotational and orbital characteristics, presents a unique challenge for calendar development. A Martian sol is approximately 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds, which translates to approximately 24.659722 Earth hours. A complete Martian year is about 687 Earth days or 668.6 sols. This paper proposes 'Mars' Master Calendar,' a calendar structure for Mars based on the International Fixed Calendar (IFC) proposal, adapted to fit the Martian sol and year. Unlike Earth, Mars requires a distinct timekeeping system that reflects its unique environment and orbital mechanics.

## Considerations for a Martian Calendar

Given the significant differences between Earth and Mars in terms of rotational periods and orbital mechanics, it is impractical to base Martian timekeeping directly on Earth's hours and months. Mars requires a unique timekeeping system that accommodates its longer sol and extended year. The first day of this proposed calendar will mark the historic moment when the first human settlement lands on Mars, symbolizing the beginning of a new interplanetary civilization and culture. On Earth, various cultures use different calendars (e.g., Gregorian, Islamic, Hebrew, Chinese) to mark time, and it is normal for individuals to navigate multiple calendar systems. Similarly, it will be essential for Martian settlers to use both the Martian and Earth calendars.

## Martian Sol Division

To create a Martian day (sol) without fractional hours, the sol is divided into 27 hours, each consisting of exactly 55 Martian minutes. This ensures a consistent division of time across the entire sol.

## Calendar Structure

The proposed 'Mars' Master Calendar' consists of 13 months, with 12 months having 51 sols each, and one month having 52 sols. An additional intercalary day is included to balance the 668.6 sols in a Martian year. This structure ensures that each month has an equal number of sols, with a slight adjustment for the final month.

### Month Breakdown

1\. Month 1: 51 sols  
2\. Month 2: 51 sols  
3\. Month 3: 51 sols  
4\. Month 4: 51 sols  
5\. Month 5: 51 sols  
6\. Month 6: 51 sols  
7\. Month 7: 51 sols  
8\. Month 8: 51 sols  
9\. Month 9: 51 sols  
10\. Month 10: 51 sols  
11\. Month 11: 51 sols  
12\. Month 12: 51 sols  
13\. Month 13: 52 sols  
14\. Intercalary Day: 1 sol  

## Week Structure

To ensure uniformity, each Martian month with 51 sols is divided into 3 weeks, each consisting of 17 sols. Each 17-sol week includes 5 rest days: 2 in the middle and 3 at the end. This structure maintains a consistent weekly cycle, which is crucial for the routine of daily life on Mars.

### Weekly Breakdown for a 51-Sol Month

1\. Week 1: Sols 1 to 17  
2\. Week 2: Sols 18 to 34  
3\. Week 3: Sols 35 to 51  

## Rest Days

In each 17-sol week, rest days are designated on the 8th, 9th, 15th, 16th, and 17th sol. Additionally, the intercalary day at the end of the 13th month serves as an extra rest day, making it a total of 6 rest days in the final week of the Martian year.

## Intercalary Day Calculation

The intercalary day is calculated to account for the remaining 0.6 sol in the Martian year. Each Martian sol consists of 1485 Martian minutes. The intercalary period of 0.6 sol translates to exactly 891 Martian minutes, which can be used as a special intercalary day.

## Conclusion

The proposed 'Mars' Master Calendar' provides a practical and consistent approach to timekeeping on Mars, aligning with the planet's unique rotational and orbital characteristics. By dividing the Martian sol into 27 hours of 55 minutes each, and structuring the calendar into 13 months with an intercalary day, the calendar maintains regularity and avoids fractional time periods. This proposal aims to facilitate future human activities and settlements on Mars, marking the beginning of a new interplanetary civilization with the first human settlement landing on Mars. Just as various cultures on Earth navigate multiple calendar systems, it will be natural for Martian settlers to use both the Martian and Earth calendars.
